# Beginner Friendly HTML-CSS-Javascript Projects

Currently I'm building beginner friendly HTML-CSS-Javascript Projects while learning. Some of them are inspired from YouTube content creators so, many many thanks to them. As a beginner I like to watch them building projects. then I try to replicate them and tweaks them in my own style.

```I will use Javascript later to make them useful :)```
