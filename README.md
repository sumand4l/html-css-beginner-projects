# Beginner Friendly HTML-CSS Projects

Currently I'm building beginner friendly HTML-CSS Projects while learning. Some of them are inspired from YouTube content creators so, many many thanks to them. As a beginner I like to watch them building projects. then I try to copy them and tweaks them in my own style. I think that's how a beginner can learn making stuffs. Yes there are several other ways to learn. But I prefer this way.

```I will use Javascript later to make them useful :)```
